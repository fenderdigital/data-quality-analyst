For this exercise I would you to tell me who the most popular Marvel Superhero is. Under data, you can find two files taken from the aws marvel superheroes dataset. 

Spec:
* In marvel-graph.txt each line represents pairings of superheroes by their ID. 
* In marvel-names.txt you will find a lookup table with the superheroes' names as well as their ID. 
* These files should be space delimited with any special characters quoted.

We would like to know who the most popular superhero is. Feel free to use any language you feel comfortable with to solve this problem. Explain any issues you may have run into while working through this exercise. The expected outcome of this exercise is that we have a discussion about your solution in an onsite interview.
